* Configure the FMCW waveform based on the system requirements.
* Define the range and velocity of target and simulate its displacement.
* For the same simulation loop process the transmit and receive signal to determine the beat signal
* Perform Range FFT on the received signal to determine the Range
* Towards the end, perform the CFAR processing on the output of 2nd FFT to display the target.
